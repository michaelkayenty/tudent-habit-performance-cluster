# tudent-habit-performance-cluster
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and clustering student performance data using unsupervised learning techniques. The primary goal is to identify patterns among students based on various academic and demographic features, which can help in targeting interventions, improving learning outcomes, and personalizing education.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze student data to understand performance trends.

Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group students with similar characteristics.

Visualize clusters to interpret key traits of high, medium, and low-performing students.

Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

🗃️ Dataset
The dataset includes information such as:

Demographic features: Gender, age, parental education level, etc.

Academic records: Math scores, reading scores, writing scores.

Other features: Lunch type, test preparation course status, etc.

📁 Dataset source: [Add your dataset source here, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle]

🧠 Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler)

Clustering Techniques

K-Means clustering (primary method)

Elbow method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters

Dimensionality Reduction

PCA for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D

Visualization

Cluster plots using Seaborn/Matplotlib

Feature importance and group comparisons

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
